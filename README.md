This is the main workflow in which all the app is based on.

As an user app, you could follow three functionalities that will allow manage the meetings. 

## 1.1 Creating a meeting

The process is quit easy. The only steps that an user has to follow are: 1) Look for participants. 2) Choosing a place from the list. 3) Choosing date and time for meeting. 4) Clicking the create bottom and done! User has created his first meeting. The app sends as much invitations as participants the meeting has. These have to be answered in 15min. After this time, the invitation for a single participant is rejected and the app will recalculate nearby places for meeting.
